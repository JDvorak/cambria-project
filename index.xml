      <title>Cambria, Weeks Five and Six: Nesting Instinct</title>

      <description>The last two weeks have been incredibly busy. We&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time getting our foundations into better shape, so let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it.
A lens for every purpose Conceptually, what we&amp;rsquo;re working on is connecting different data structures together while supporting bi-directional conversions.
The simplest case to think about is renaming a property.
graph LRd1(&#34;name: Get Milk&#34;) --&#34;rename(name, title)&#34;-- d2(&#34;title: Get Milk&#34;)d2 --&#34;rename(title, name)&#34;--d1It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how this lens could run in either direction.</description>

      <description>As part of designing the new integration between Chitin and our CRDTs, Martin wrote a tiny two-hundred line version of Automerge called Micromerge that displays the core behaviours of automerge with none of the additional complexity of production software.
I have included it here in its complete form:
const ROOT_ID = &amp;#39;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;#39; /** * Miniature implementation of a subset of Automerge. Supports the following: * - only map, list, and primitive datatypes (no table, text, counter, or date objects) * - no undo/redo * - no conflicts on concurrent updates to the same field (uses last-writer-wins instead) * - no API for creating new changes (you need to create change objects yourself) * - no buffering of changes that are missing their causal dependencies * - no saving or loading in serialised form * - relies on object mutation (no immutability) */ class Micromerge { constructor() { this.</description>

      <title>Chitin, v4: Op Log Example</title>
      <link>http://inkandswitch.github.io/cambria/designs/chitin-v4/</link>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a concrete example to illustrate how the &amp;ldquo;op log&amp;rdquo; based Chitin 4 system works, and then some brief explanation of why it&amp;rsquo;s better than our previous iterations.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have three related schemas for a Task (listed below), which have evolved as we develop the app. Our goal is that clients can read/write to the same document using any of the schemas.
V1 {title: stringdescription: string}// - rename title to name// - add a complete booleanV2 {name: stringdescription: stringcomplete: boolean}// - change the complete boolean to a 3-valued &amp;quot;status&amp;quot; fieldV3 {name: stringdescription: stringstatus: string}In Chitin 4, writes are straightforward.</description>

      <description>I wrote you a nice week three post but didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to sharing it. You can read it if you like, but briefly, in week three we managed to connect the two ends of the project: we managed to add features to our issue tracker using Cambria.
Once we&amp;rsquo;d managed to do that, we stepped back, squinted at what we&amp;rsquo;d done and asked ourselves whether it was the right shape.</description>

      <title>On Scalar to Array Conversions</title>
      <link>http://inkandswitch.github.io/cambria/designs/converting-scalar-to-arrays/</link>

      <description>Imagine an issue tracker which has gone from 0-1 assignees (nullable scalar) to 0-n (array) What should happen when the two versions make writes?
In general, we can consider the old version (denoted {} in examples) as a window onto the head of the new version&amp;rsquo;s array (denoted []).
Reads In the simplest case, both values are empty.
[{}]With a single value, the read semantics are equivalent.
[{&amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot;}]Given additional values added to the new version, the old version would see just the head of the list.</description>

      <description>This week we joined the two ends of the chunnel. The problem and the solution met in the middle and now we have a working system performing migrations on top of Cambria!
Mostly.
We do indeed have a working end-to-end system, with a rudimentary developer experience that allows developers to write migrations in a simple lens language and have their data automatically migrated to and from that format in any client.</description>

      <description>Last week we showed you a demo of a problem. We wanted to run two different versions of a program, both operating on different data types&amp;hellip; but with the same underlying document.
This is a tricky problem! The old code doesn&amp;rsquo;t natively understand data written by the new system. The new system relies on data the old one doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide. Worst, even in our little toy example there is one field where the data type changes completely, going from a Boolean type to a string.</description>

      <description>Welcome, one and all to the Cambria project. Cambria is an ongoing research project here at Ink &amp;amp; Switch exploring how we can operate on evolving data formats in a decentralized system. We hope this work will be exciting not just for folks working on decentralized systems but could also be applicable more broadly to other distributed systems.
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? Cambria was motivated by some problems we kept seeing in our work.</description>
