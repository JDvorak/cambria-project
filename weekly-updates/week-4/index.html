in week three we managed to connect the two ends of the project: we managed to add features to our issue tracker using
Cambria.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;d managed to do that, we stepped back, squinted at what we&rsquo;d done and asked ourselves whether it was the right
shape. My dear reader, it was not!</p>
<p>The week three prototype was wrong in three important respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>it didn&rsquo;t actually solve the right problem</li>
<li>it produced incorrect results</li>
<li>it couldn&rsquo;t do a lot of the things we needed</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided that bugs and missing features were big problems (more on that later), but that if we didn&rsquo;t build software
which addressed an actual human problem found in the field we were just wasting our time.</p>
<h1 id="an-actual-human-problem">An Actual Human Problem</h1>
<p>Our first few prototypes were designed to demonstrate the concept behind Cambria: that you could have multiple versions
of a piece of software running in the field and yet still interoperate despite evolving application types.</p>
<p>If you watch the recorded demos, I think Geoffrey demonstrates this pretty well, with two copies of the same program
running side-by-side even in the same window.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s very rare for anyone to run two copies of the same program simultaneously in the same window. It&rsquo;s
much more common for developers to run a single copy at a time and then to have to merge in patches sent by their
collaborators, and that didn&rsquo;t really work <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d optimized for the experience of our demos (which we took to calling the Researcher Experience, or RX) instead of the
developer experience (DX) of building real software.</p>
<p>We made a few changes to fix this, but the biggest was that we now treat our lenses more like a migrations directory,
and produce the types your program will use by summing up all the lenses found there. This means that if you pull a 
branch in from a collaborator you shouldn&rsquo;t have to take any manual fix-up steps to get their code working.</p>
<p>As we thought through the consequences of this change we realized that our current propagating-lens-patches model was
not going to work. It would incorrectly orphan some changes, and worse, the same problem meant that async collaboration 
was broken too.</p>
<h1 id="fixing-cambria">Fixing Cambria</h1>
<p>The current version of Cambria is becoming increasingly ergonomic. At this point, we think we&rsquo;re close to solving a 
useful problem and having a good interface to do so. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll be returning our attention to the functioning of
the system along two key axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>nesting documents is not implemented</li>
<li>we probably ought to stop losing data</li>
</ol>
<p>You might (reasonably) think that #2 there is important enough to ignore #1. In fact, because of the division of
Chitin (storage format, distribution, types) and Cloudina (lenses and patch translation) we can tackle them in parallel.</p>
<p>Our plan for fixing nesting documents looks a lot like work we&rsquo;ve seen coming out of Benjamin Pierce&rsquo;s group at UPenn,
with symmetric edit lenses looking promising. We have a few advantages of their usual approach, in particular that because
we instrument users&rsquo; code directly we don&rsquo;t have to guess at intent &ndash; we can instrument it.</p>
<p>As to the correctness problem, well, we&rsquo;re trying something new based around a <a href="./designs/chitin-v4">log of all operations</a>. It seems 
promising thus far, but we&rsquo;re coming dangerously close to building a new CRDT on top of an existing one and so we need
to reconcile that.</p>
<h1 id="out--about">Out &amp; About</h1>
<p>We had a lovely audience for our last project demo from several folks who responded to an earlier update with interest in our work from their own past histories, including (alphabetically by author) <a href="https://dcreager.net/publications/012-dphil-thesis/">Douglas Creeger&rsquo;s PhD</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deadwisdom/blazon">Blazon</a> (Brantley Harris), and <a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/tree/master/schemas">IPLD Schemas</a> (Eric Myhre).</p>
<h1 id="q-how-do-you-track-time-to-live-for-a-version-so-you-know-when-you-can-retire-the-old-one">Q: How do you track &ldquo;time to live&rdquo; for a version so you know when you can retire the old one?</h1>
<p>In a centralised system, you want to know when enough of your old clients are upgraded to the new version so you can 
remove support for older versions. The Cambria library works more like an ActiveRecord migrations directory &ndash; the code
automatically migrates old data up to the new version when it encounters it, so you don&rsquo;t need to think about deprecating old versions. It can also migrate the data down to older versions to ensure backwards support.</p>
<h1 id="q-what-happens-when-youre-simply-missing-data-that-a-new-or-old-version-needs">Q: What happens when you&rsquo;re simply missing data that a new or old version needs?</h1>
<p>We can&rsquo;t invent data for you, but we could detect, for example, if an older version of the software required a certain
field and it has become optional in the new version. Cambria, by its nature, forces you to notice and think about this
problem as you write your lens migration. You might choose to fill in a default value, or to deliberately crash the old
program. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to send a too-wide license plate to an old stamping machine, for example, or to map missing data to an arbitrary location.</p>
