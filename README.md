# Cambria

Cambria is a Javascript/Typescript library for converting JSON data between related schemas.

You specify (in YAML or JSON) a _lens_, which specifies a data transformation. Cambria lets you use this lens to convert:

- a whole document, in JSON
- an edit to a document, in [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/)
- a schema description, in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)

Lenses are bidirectional. Once you've converted a document from schema A to schema B, you can edit the document in schema B and propagate those edits _backwards through the same lens_ to schema A.

For more background on why Cambria exists and what it can do, see the research essay. (todo: link once released)

## Use cases

- Manage backwards compatibility in a JSON API
- Manage database migrations for JSON data
- Transform a JSON document into a different shape on the command line
- Combine with [cambria-automerge](https://github.com/inkandswitch/cambria-automerge) to collaborate on documents across multiple versions of [local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)

## Install

If you're using npm, run `npm install cambria`. If you're using yarn, run `yarn add cambria`. Then you can import it with `require('cambria')` as in the examples (or `import * as Cambria from 'cambria'` if using ES2015 or TypeScript).
