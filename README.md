# Cambria

Cambria is a Javascript/Typescript library for converting JSON data bidirectionally between related schemas.

A lens can convert:

- a whole document, in JSON
- an edit to a document, in [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/)
- a schema description, in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)

For more background on why Cambria exists and what it can do, see the research essay. (todo: link once released)

## Use cases

- Manage backwards compatibility in a JSON API
- Manage database migrations for JSON data
- Transform a JSON document into a different shape on the command line
- Combine with [cambria-automerge](https://github.com/inkandswitch/cambria-automerge) to collaborate on documents across multiple versions of [local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)
